The codes were written in C++, and can be compiled in any compiler that supports the C++98 standard.

The Make file is written for the GNU Make 3.81 (the version on the student server).

The codes were developed under the following linux servers:
* ubuntu1204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca (server)
* ubuntu1204-004.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca (client)

Since the CPU type may be different, so both the client and the server must be compiled separately.

To run the server, do the following:
* unpack the tarball in any location that you'd like to run it
* run ``make server"
* run ``./server"
* At this point, you should be able to see the value of n_port.

Then for the client, do the following:
* unpack the tarball
* run ``make client"
* run ``./client ubuntu1204-002 [n_port] [the message]"
* then you should be able to the message in reverse order
